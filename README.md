 ## Testing
  Unit tests are a fundamental aspect of software development. They serve as the first line of defense against defects, ensuring that individual components of an application function correctly. Hereâ€™s an elaboration on the paragraph you provided
  Unit tests are automated tests designed to verify the correctness of small, isolated units of code (usually functions or methods) in isolation.
   They validate whether each unit behaves as expected, adhering to its specified functionality.
  Unit tests isolate specific code segments, allowing developers to focus on individual units without considering the entire system.
